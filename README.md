# Mc Injection

Fully C++ Minecraft injection client for linux. Mapping code and 1.12 mappings are based off of
[UDP](https://github.com/UnknownDetectionParty/Phantom-CPP), most of the rest in my own. To build, make sure
you have cmake installed, as well as a JDK. I was having issues with openjdk 1.8, I would recommend using the
latest version of openjdk. Cmake will automatically find the files associated and link with them. You also
need the development headers for SDL2 and OpenGL.
